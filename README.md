# Heart-Disease-Risk-Estimation
Estimation of heart disease using patient's data like age, gender, Blood Pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar etc.. 


We found that the ‘opst’ and ‘dests’ contain about 60% which is the highest correlation.
‘Thal’ is gonna play a significant role has since it has got highest correlation with the predicted
variable ‘a1p2’ .
We can neglect either ‘opst’ or ‘dests’ since they are highly correlated.
